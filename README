VIZ for Splunk by Marinus van Aswegen (mvanaswegen AT gmail.com) v0.1 

Creates a graph based on the relationship between two fields i.e. sourch, destination, protocol.
It builds a graphviz dot file, which is then passed to graphviz for rendering.
  
BE WARNED no precations have been taken to prevent bad things from happening i.e. overwriting of sensitive files, etc
  
Usage

*  | viz field1=x field2=y [lable=z] file=name [engine=dot|neato|twopi|circo|...] [seq=true|false] [flatten=true|false] [graphviz options]
  
  field1, field2 indicate the primary graphing nodes
  label indicates the relationship, can be blank
  file specifies where to write the graph to
  engine allows you to select the graphviz rendering engine, defaults to dot if left blank
  flatten will perform a unique on relationships between nodes, default false
  seq will add a nr to each label as the data is parsed by splunk, useful to follow a seqence of events
  you can add graphviz command directly on the search line i.e. rankdir=RL
  
 Examples
 
 * | viz fiel1=from fiels2=to label=subject file=/tmp/maillog.png engine=circo seq=true ranksep=1.0
 
 * | viz fiel1=ip1 fiels2=ip2 label=protocol file=/tmp/network.png flatten=true 
 
 feedbak appreciated
